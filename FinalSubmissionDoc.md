# Final Submission
## Instructions
This repo uses Git LFS. If you don't have Git LFS you wont clone the occlusion culling data and might need to bake that file again, which takes forever. Clone the repo and run the unity files. If you want to just get a build of the project, use this link to google drive for a mac and windows build.
