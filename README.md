## The Goal
The goal of this assignment is to get a completely autonomous space battle to play out while two Jedi Interceptors to follow a long path through the carnage. One of the Jedi’s will be following a designated path whilst the other offset pursues the first. 

The space battle will have two separate parts. The one part is between Droid and Republican star destroyers. These will slowly fly past each other and shoot their space cannons. This should play out similarly to naval battles where the ships can only shoot each other if they are beside each other. 

The second part will be the republican and droid starfighters. A dog fighting system will be inplace where the ships will start chasing each other. The chaser will try to shoot its target whilst the target tries to evade the pursuer. Ships that have nothing to do will look for allies to help out.

To track the battle a fully autonomous cameraman ai will be inplace to create and place unity cameras where ever the action is. The cameras will also use steering behaviours to follow ships and show the action from many interesting angles.
